          â€‹Outside of code, I like to push myself in other ways, whether that involves trying a new experience or going further than I have before on a long hike, I'm always pushing myself to improve upon the person I was yesterday.

           Previously, I've undergone an apprenticeship at Thinkful, studied computer engineering at Cascadia College, and done volunteer work for The Northwest Harvest.
