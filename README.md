# [Taylor Merrill](http://www.tmerrill.net/)

Hi! I'm Taylor. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer highly skilled in | React | Redux | Javascript | Node.js | MERN Stack based in Salt Lake City.
I'm comfortable throughout the stack, and I love pushing my boundaries and solving complex issues.

Outside of code, I like to push myself in other ways, whether that involves trying a new experience or going further than I have before on a long hike, I'm always pushing myself to improve upon the person I was yesterday.

Previously, I've undergone an apprenticeship at Thinkful, studied computer engineering at Cascadia College, and done volunteer work for The Northwest Harvest.
